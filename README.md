Translations
----
All the translation files for Lumina are available through the PC-BSD pootle translations systems, which are then auto-committed to the pcbsd/lumina-i18n repo. This provides an easy interface through which to contribute translations while also ensuring that the translation files are kept in sync with the Lumina source files, and it is highly recommended that translators use this interface.
